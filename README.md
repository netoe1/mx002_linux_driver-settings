## Introduction
Hi, I'm Ely Torres Neto, from Vertex Project.

Currently, I have a pen desk with mx002 chip, but unfortnally, we don't have that drivers for linux.
So, I looked up and found a project that solved my problem, but it's kinda hard code, good, but without a receptive interface for common users.

I decided to grab these driver and make my own version, forking from a project that drivers are already coded, adding a interface to change some configs, avoid direct changing things in code.

## Dependencies
- rustp
- cargo
- python3 and pip (check your linux distribution!)
